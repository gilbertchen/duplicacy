Please **use the [Duplicacy Forum](https://forum.duplicacy.com/)** when reporting bugs, making feature requests, asking for help or simply praising Duplicacy for its ease of use.

We strongly encourage you to create an account on the forum and use that platform for discussion as there is a higher chance that someone there will talk to you. 

There is a handful of people watching the Github Issues and we are in the process of moving **all** of them to the forum as well.

We have already created a comprehensive [Guide](https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/duplicacy-user-guide/1197), and a [How-To](https://forum.duplicacy.com/c/how-to) category which stores more wisdom than these issues on Github.
